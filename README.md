Full explanation of what your program does
-
I initially started trying to create a sports data API - bot, but after searching for a couple days for a free, current, and usable API, I could not find one (mostly the free part was the problem). So, I turned to creating a ChatGPT bot that could theoretically show past sports data, even though it is not current, as well as do many other things. 
Upon typing the start codes: /ai, /bot, or /chatgpt, and entering a prompt afterwards, the Discord Bot uses the ChatGPT API to compile a response and administer it in Discord.
